    <h1>Late Blight of Tomato</h1>
    
    <h2>Disease Information</h2>
    <p>Late blight, caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans, is one of the most 
    destructive diseases of tomato and potato worldwide. The disease can rapidly destroy entire 
    fields under favorable environmental conditions.</p>
    
    <h2>Symptoms</h2>
    <p>Initial symptoms appear as water-soaked lesions on leaves, typically starting on lower 
    foliage. Under humid conditions, a white fuzzy growth (sporangia) develops on the underside 
    of leaves. Lesions quickly turn brown to black and coalesce, causing extensive leaf blight.</p>
    
    <p>On stems, late blight causes dark brown to black lesions that can girdle the plant. 
    Fruit infection results in large, greasy-appearing brown spots that remain firm.</p>
    
    <h2>Disease Cycle</h2>
    <p>The pathogen overwinters in infected potato tubers or tomato debris. Sporangia are 
    produced on infected tissue and disseminated by wind and rain. Under cool (15-20°C) and 
    wet conditions, sporangia germinate within hours and infect plant tissue.</p>
    
    <h2>Management Strategies</h2>
    
    <h3>Cultural Practices</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Plant resistant or tolerant varieties when available</li>
        <li>Avoid overhead irrigation; use drip irrigation instead</li>
        <li>Space plants adequately to promote air circulation</li>
        <li>Remove and destroy infected plant debris</li>
        <li>Rotate crops with non-host plants for at least 2 years</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Chemical Control</h3>
    <p>Preventive fungicide applications are critical for late blight management. Start 
    applications before disease appears, especially during periods of favorable weather.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chlorothalonil</strong>: Broad-spectrum protectant fungicide. Apply at 
        7-10 day intervals. Rate: 1.5-2.0 lb/acre.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Mancozeb</strong>: Multi-site protectant fungicide. Apply at 7-10 day 
        intervals. Rate: 1.5-2.0 lb/acre.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Copper-based products</strong>: Organic option. Apply weekly during 
        disease-favorable conditions. Various formulations available.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Azoxystrobin</strong>: Systemic fungicide with protectant and curative 
        activity. Alternate with protectant fungicides to prevent resistance. Rate: 6.0-15.5 
        fl oz/acre.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Mandipropamid</strong>: Systemic fungicide specific for oomycetes. 
        Tank-mix with protectant fungicides. Rate: 5.5-8.0 fl oz/acre.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Integrated Approach</h3>
    <p>Best results are achieved by combining cultural practices with timely fungicide 
    applications. Monitor weather forecasts and use disease prediction models like Blitecast 
    or Tomcast to optimize spray timing.</p>
    
    <h2>Regional Considerations - Philippines</h2>
    <p>In the Philippines, late blight is particularly severe in highland tomato production 
    areas during the wet season. Mountain provinces like Benguet experience significant losses 
    if preventive measures are not implemented.</p>
    
    <p>The Department of Agriculture recommends starting fungicide applications at first flower 
    and continuing throughout the season during rainy periods. Combination products containing 
    both protectant and systemic fungicides are widely used.</p>
