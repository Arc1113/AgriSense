Tomato productivity in Ilocos Region to be addressed with integrated crop management

A project that aims to increase tomato productivity through integrated crop management (ICM) in the Ilocos Region was monitored before the implementation of the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ).
The ICM technologies being tested are the combination of healthy seedling technology, modified release strategy of biological control agents (BCAs), and site-specific nutrient management.
Now in its final year, the project, "Development of Integrated Crop Management (ICM-Tomato) for Increasing the Productivity of Fresh and Processing Tomato Production Using Adaptable Technologies and Site-Specific Pest and Nutrient Management," was monitored by the team composed of the Crops Research Division (CRD) of the Philippine Council for Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural Resources Research and Development of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST-PCAARRD), various units of the University of the Philippines Los Banos (UPLB), and the Northern Foods Corporation (NFC).
The monitoring team, led by Joel Norman R. Panganiban, Industry Strategic S&T Program (ISP) Manager for Vegetables from CRD-PCAARRD, evaluated the technologies' effectiveness to control the most prevalent diseases of tomatoes such as tomato leaf curl virus (TLCV) disease, early and late blight, bacterial wilt caused by
Ralstonia solanacearum , and Fusarium wilt.
The project sites are located in the municipalities of Sinait, Ilocos Sur; Paoay, Batac, and Dingras in Ilocos Norte. Experiments of ICM technologies in the said sites were conducted under high disease pressure.
According to project leader, Dr. Filomena C. Sta. Cruz of the Institute of Weed Science, Entomology and Plant Pathology (IWEP) of UPLB, the virus causing TLCV disease, a strain unique in the Philippines, is transmitted by white flies. Due to severe infection in the sites, stunting and delayed flowering of tomatoes were observed.
Other members of the research team include: Dr. Pablito G. Gonzales of the National Crop Protection Center (NCPC), Dr. Annalissa L. Aquino of the Institute of Crop Science (ICropS) under the College of Agriculture and Food Science (CAFS), UPLB, and Engr. Norberto D. Mendoza of NFC.
Before the program ends, the team will develop information, education, and communication (IEC) materials for the recommended ICM-Tomato Program for fresh and processing tomato production in the Ilocos Region. As a follow through, the team will also propose a program to develop a TLCV- resistant or tolerant variety and a multi-location trial of the ICM-Tomato Program for fresh and processing tomato production in other tomato growing regions of the country.
