## 2. Land Selection And Preparation

The selection of the field site is crucial for the success of the grower. The exposition of the crop to any biotic (pests and diseases) and abiotic (water, nutrients, temperature) stress depends on the site proper-
ties. However, in practice the grower is commonly restricted to his land property and choices are limited.

showing the actual price, this graph shows the rela- tion of the market price in different months to the
yearly average.
With reference to the average market price, in the initial four months of the year January to April, the
market price showed down-trend and was lower than the average. In the next three months May,
June and July, prices trended above average while the price remained at average in the second half of
the year, August to December.

contains a number of micro-organisms which is beyond counting, including the crop and competing plants, the
climate and water supply, management aspects other environmental influences, it is impossible to predict the
actual nutrient requirement of the crop in a particular field exactly. Nutrient supply, availability and losses
determine the fertilization requirements. Data given in this manual are based on a series of recommendations
from the literature and practitioners. However, for a good fertilization program, it is necessary to keep in
mind all important aspects, rather than following one single recommendation. A soil test based nutrient rec-
ommendation should be treated as one component of a fertilization plan.

Traditionally, farmers in the Madanapalle region have been using organic materials as mulch. The
benefits are that they keep soil temperatures cool and they are inexpensive, natural and bio-degrad-
able. The disadvantages are a lack of sufficient material to cover large crop areas and the danger of
spreading pathogens through any undecomposed plant wastes applied near the root zone. It is, there-
fore recommended not to use organic mulch origi- nating from tomato, chili or brinjal plants in tomato
production.
Figure 2-4 Benefits of mulching. Depending on the site of production and the kind of mulch used, sever-

A good recycling technique is essential to protect the environment.
Some farmers have experienced weeds emerging through these mulch sheets. Using a thicker mulch
sheet of 40 microns has been reported to solve the problem. But the use of thicker films has not been
widely adopted, as the higher material cost doubles the total cost of mulching.

## 2.7.1 Recommended Spacing Of Transplanted Seedlings

Two kinds of planting can be recommended for to- mato based on the season, land preparation and the
variety grown.

## 2.7.1.1 Single Row Of Seedlings On Each Bed

Generally, semi-determinate varieties that have a rigorous growing habit are planted in a single row
on a raised bed / flat bed. The recommended dis- tance between the rows is 4 feet (120 cm) and the
spacing between the plants in the row is 1.5 feet (40 cm) (Figure 2-7).
When mulching is done manually on the raised beds, round holes are made as per the recommend-
ed spacing (4 ft x 1.5 ft, or 120 cm x 45 cm) using a punch or a large diameter pipe and a hammer. In
case of machine laying, holes are cut in the mulch by the machine. WorldVeg - South Asia field

## 2.7.1.2 Two Rows Of Seedlings On Each Raised Bed:

Determinate varieties that grow to a set height of 2-3 feet can be planted in a paired row on a raised bed.
Looking at marketable yields as well as the yields of large fruit, it was clear that the trend on the determi- nate types was towards yielding the best at the highest plant populations.10 The typical spacing between
the paired rows on a bed is 50 cm and 120 cm between two raised beds. The spacing between the plants in the row is 40 cm.

## 3.5 Choosing A Good Source Of Seedlings

Choosing the right variety and the right nursery to provide healthy seedlings are essential for a good
crop. How the seedlings are grown affects how fast they recover from transplanting shock, and their
susceptibility to pests and diseases. Good seedlings can make all the difference to growing a healthy
crop, so choosing a reliable nursery is essential.
Farmers often take the variety provided by a nurs- ery, but if they prefer to cultivate a particular vari-
ety, they will need to work with a nursery to grow the seedlings correctly. In choosing a reliable nurs-
ery, farmers should look for the following things.
How to select healthy seedlings
Observe the hygiene of the nursery: It is always import- Check the foliage: Pale and yellow foliage might indicate ant to obtain seedlings from a clean and well maintained a nitrogen deficiency. Look for a uniform colour on all the

Look at the roots: A poor root system will produce a weak plant. Pick the seedlings that have a strongly developed
root system to help them perform better in the field.
Avoid over-aged seedlings: It is recommended to transplant 25-30 days old seedlings. Older transplants
may produce earlier yields, but may bring more pest and disease problems.

To achieve this balance, remove all the suckers up to the one immediately below the first flower cluster

through the irrigation system. The best means of 5.5.1 Basal fertilization fertilization is fertigation. Fertilizer is applied with

Nutrients applied to the leaves are taken up by the plant faster. The effects can be seen immediately

In general, foliar sprays of micronutrients promote fruit growth and quality. Whether and how much
to spray depends mainly on the costs. Generally, it is most useful, when access to high value markets

When high yielding varieties are used and yield expectations are high, weekly sprays with calcium

## Postharvest Losses Of Tomato Are One Of The Most Important Economic Losses For Farmers, But Are Of-

ten the least considered. WorldVeg research across three countries in South Asia found average post-

## Harvest Losses Of Tomatoes Of 25%. These Losses Oc- Cur After All The Expenses Of Growing The Crop Have

been made. Poor harvest timing, transport and storage mean that farmers lose a significant part of
their crop when it is most valuable.
Tomatoes have a very short market life if harvested fully ripe. Mature-green or breaker stage fruit may
last for several weeks. Tomato fruits are very deli- cate and can quickly be injured by rough harvesting
and handling practices. The fruit is also damaged by holding at either too low or too high a temperature.
Proper postharvest handling and storage methods are essential for maintaining acceptable quality and
extending the market life.

## 7.1 Harvest Maturity Indices

The most widely used index of tomato maturity is skin colour. Distinct changes in external colour occur
in tomato fruit that can be used to determine har- vest maturity.
With red skinned cultivars, after the mature-green stage the tip of the blossom end will change to a
pinkish-yellow colour, which is commonly referred to as the 'breaker stage'. The breaker stage usually
occurs within a day after the mature-green stage.
The entire fruit then turns colour to pink, followed by light red, and finally deep red.
The ripening stages of mature tomato fruit are cat- egorized as green, breaker, turning, pink, light red,
and red. Knowing the maturity index and harvest- ing accordingly will help the farmer decide on the
suitable market. For example, Madanpalle market prefers fully ripe red colored fruits at stage-6.

the heat of the day should be avoided where possi- ble. Harvested fruit should be cooled down as much
as possible to prolong the shelf life. Although the main grading on-farms is usually to remove the most
damaged fruit, further grading for quality can make For distant markets a big difference in market. Buyers only examine a Mature-green stage, or the breaker

## 7.3 Preparing For Market

The harvested tomatoes are usually packed in crates to transport them to the market. It is not advisable
to pack them either in gunny bags or any other closed container to prevent damage to the fruits.
During all operations, from harvest through packing, the fruit should be handled carefully to avoid bruis-
ing and injury to the tissue.
Bruises can affect ripening and cuts or injuries to the skin and predispose the fruit to invasion of
decay-causing organisms. The fruit should be kept cool in a well-ventilated shaded area during market
preparation. Avoid over packing in each crate.
Figure 7-2 Crates in which tomatoes are packed at the
Field Grown Tomatoes Production Technology Guide Madanapalle, Andhra Pradesh 55

## 7.4 Cleaning

The initial step in preparing tomatoes for market is to clean the surface of the fruit and remove any dirt,
surface stains, or adhering leaf tissue. This will help in preventing further damage to the fruit during
transportation.

## 7.5 Grading

The harvested tomatoes must be sorted and graded before packing for market. Sorting should remove
fruit that is too old, insect damaged, with broken skins or fruit that is too large or too small.
It is suggested to go for the first level of grading, of removing the damage and bruised fruits at the farm
level, to retain the quality of healthy produce. As a general practice at Madanapalle, grading is taken up
by the traders at the market engaging some skilled labour who are paid by the farmers.

8. MACHINERY AND TOOLS 8.1 Easy planter
- This is a simple implement used to transplant tomato seedlings.
- Manual transplanting is very tedious. Initially the mulch sheet has to be punched and the seedlings
- have to be planted manually into the hole. To trans- plant an area of 4000 sq m in a day, about 10-12
- people will be required.
- With the help of an easy planter, transplanting in the same area can be done in around 4 hours with just
- three persons; one person to bring the seedlings, another one to carry the trays and the third one to
- operate the planter. The cost of planter is affordable to small and marginal farmers.
- The easy planter is a 3 foot (100 cm) long hollow tube supported with a lever. The hollow tube is open at
- one end into which the seedlings are dropped. The other end tapers down to insert the seedling into the
- soil.
- A seedling is dropped into the tube after it has been pushed through the mulch and creating a planting
- hole where the seedling is to be transplanted. When the lever is pressed the seedling drops into the hole
- created by the tube.
- The operator does not need to bend over, and by standing and transplanting there is less back strain.
- Figure 8-1 Operating an easy planter
- Field Grown Tomatoes Production Technology Guide Madanapalle, Andhra Pradesh 57

## 8.2 Mulching Machine

A simple plastic mulch laying machine works well with a small tractor to reduce labour costs. It can be used for bed preparation, mulch and drip pipe laying, and evenly spaced hole punching for transplanting

## 8.3 Power Tiller

This is a farm implement for stirring and pulverizing the soil, either before planting or to remove weeds and to aerate and loosen the soil after the crop has begun to grow.
It can be used in fields where the recommended spacing is adopted.
Figure 8-2 Power tiller for seedbed preparation

9. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 1. How long in a day should we irrigate the tomato crop through drip?
- How long to irrigate with drip irrigation system depends on the following things:
- What is my crop?
- In what development stage is the crop?
- How are the weather conditions?
- What kind of drippers am I using?
- What is the distance between the drippers?
- Refer to paragraph 5.2 in the manual for closer information. A short calculation can be derived from
- Figure 5-2. Showing the amount of irrigation in m3/ha for different months depending on the plant ing time. Table 5-1 shows, how long one needs to irrigate depending on the kind of drippers used
- and the dripper spacing. Observe: If you have a uniform lay-out of the irrigation system, the duration of irrigation is independent of the area irrigated.
2. How to control Blossom end rot in Tomato?
- Blossom end rot comes from calcium (Ca) deficiency. In general, spraying Ca-containing fertilizers is most effective.

## Soil Based Ca-Fertilization May Help, But Often, If The Crop Grows Fast, Ca Does Not Reach The Fruit Quick Enough. Therefore, Foliar Application Is Recommended.

3. How to control viral diseases in Tomato Crop?
- As in human medicine there is no real remedy to viral diseases. Some precautions can be taken:
- Avoid vector pests, such as white fly or thrips • Remove infected plants / plant parts and destroy them (burning, burying)
- Clean your pruning tools when moving from one plant to the next
- Refer to section 6.6 in the manual 4. How to prevent and control late blight in tomato?
- Prevention: staking helps for creating a good microclimate.
- Treatment: Copper hydroxide, see 6.7.5 5. What is the fertigation schedule for tomato to get 40 tons per acre?
- A yield of 40 metric tonnes would extract approximately 130 kg N, 20 kg P O and 130 kg K O.
- 2 5 2
- Follow the field preparation as in chapter 2, including a basal organic fertilization. Then apply the same fertigation schedule as in table 5-5, but double the amount of urea and MOP(if SOP is used 10-
- 20% of higher dose is recomended. If your soil has a very low organic matter content, add a base dressing of 10 kg MAP/acre.
6. How to control bacterial wilt in tomato?
- As most bacterial infections they are carried over from infected plants to healthy plants. Remove and destroy infected plant material. Avoid planting tomato after tomato, brinjal, chili or potatoes.
- It's better to avoid the plot infested by bacterial wilt. If not possible, apply enriched neem cake @1000kg per acre See 6.7.2
- Field Grown Tomatoes Production Technology Guide Madanapalle, Andhra Pradesh 59

7. How to control Tuta absoluta?
- At the moment, there is no reliable remedy against the South American pin worm. Refer to the sections 6.5 to identify an early infestation of the leaves. Even it looks similar to the leaf miner, it
- can be distinguished by the clustered damage and the absence of labyrinth-like patterns on the leaf surface. Remove and destroy infected leaves and fruit. (see 6.5.3)
8. In our area the tomatoes turn into pink color, what is the reason?
- The phenomenon is not well researched and there is no clear answer to this question.
- However, there are some possible reasons. Discoloration can be a sign of nutrient deficiency, espe cially potassium (K). So, if more than 50% of the fruit in a particular area are affected, check the N
- and K supply. High temperatures could be a reason. Possibly, a lower number of affected fruit could be a normal phenomenon during the months of April to June.
9. How much farm yard manure can be applied for tomato crop?
- FYM, if well composted has no negative effects and excessive application is no problem to the plants. However, incompletely fermented FYM may have low pH and may harm the seedling when
- getting in contact. A thick layer of FYM may negatively influence the aeration of the soil and lead to rot and fungal diseases.
- Excessive application of FYM means that the efficiency of nutrient use decreases. There are more nutrients applied, that can be turned over in one year. This is an economic loss.
- Follow paragraph 2.4 and apply 10 metric tonnes FYM / ha (4 t/acre) along with other soil amendments, if possible.
- (see 2.4.2) 10. How to differentiate between powdery mildew and late blight disease in Tomato?
- Late blight can be identified by characteristic brown spots on the vines. However, distinction is not so important as control measures are basically the same, see 6.7.6
11. How do you select good transplants at nurseries?
- Refer to paragraph 3.5 in this manual. Basically select a good nursery.
12. How often fertilizer application is needed?
- N and K fertilizers, e.g. urea and MOP should be applied often and in small quantities. If using ferti gation, follow the instructions in table 5-5. If broadcasting, use the quantities given in table 5-3 and
- split the total amount of urea and MOP in three to four applications per season.
13. Does the fertigation schedule vary for different soil types?
- The fertigation schedule is the same for all common soils. Refer to table 5-5.
14. Under what conditions tomatoes will not set flowers?
- Night temperatures above 21 or below 13 degrees C.
- Day temperatures above 32 degrees C combined with low humidity and/or drought. Hot drying winds can add to the problem.

- Dry soil can cause blossoms to dry up and drop.
- Too much nitrogen fertilizer produces leafy growth at the expense of flowers and fruits.
- Viral diseases, such as, curly top, mosaic viruses, etc. can affect flowering and fruit set.
- (see 5.9) 15. Can I save seeds from current tomato seedlings for next season's plantings?
- Not, if they are hybrids.
16. What happens if tomato plants are not staked?
- They grow slower and make less use of the space on the field, so there is less yield
- There is less wind and air circulation, increasing fungal diseases
- Some fruit is on the ground, thus, diseases and mechanical damage. (see section 4.1) 17. What are the benefits of mulching in tomato crop?
- Refer to section 2.6 in the manual 18. How to prevent bird damage to tomato crop?
- Either scare crows or mechanical protection (Nets, guns...) 19. What causes blossom end rot in tomatoes?
- It is calcium deficiency (see question 2) 20. What is the best time to harvest tomatoes? Early morning, early evening etc.
- This depends on the handling chain. The time between harvesting and selling should be short.
- Avoid high temperatures, so morning and evening are good.
- Do not expose the harvested tomatoes to direct sunlight.
- Cool them if possible.
21. What is the color of tomatoes for harvesting?
- Depends on the use. Refer to section 7.1 in the manual 22. Why do tomatoes crack and how to prevent this problem?
- Cracking is a problem of excessive growth, which can be due to excessive fertilization or a period of drought followed by quick re-watering. See 5.9
23. What causes tomato leaves to curl?
- Leaf curl virus, see section 6.7.7 24. How do you identify a tomato variety as determinate or indeterminate?
- Section 3.2
- Field Grown Tomatoes Production Technology Guide Madanapalle, Andhra Pradesh 61

25. What are the common weeds of tomato?
- There are no specific weeds associated with tomato. For weed management refer to section 2.3.1 26. What is the best season of growing tomato?
- See Section 2.1 27. What are the important pests and diseases of tomato?
- All listed in Section 6 28. How do we do soil solarisation? What are its benefits?
- Irrigate the field. Cover the soil with plastic mulch (best is black) for about two weeks and expose to radiation in dry weather conditions. The soil will heat up to the point that freshly germinated
- weeds die during their most vulnerable stage of development.
29. What is the difference between breeder seed, foundation seed and certified seed?
- A breeder's seed is an offspring of a genetically pure seed; produced by mutual multiplication of three different lines which are denoted by A line, B line and R line. A line is female, while B and R
- line are male sterile. The seeds from their off springs with best and desired quality are selected and certified as Breeder seeds.
- The Breeder seed is further multiplied into the foundation and certified seeds.
- Offspring of the Breeder seed that can be clearly traced to Breeder seed are called Foundation
- Seeds. Certified seed is the progeny of foundation seed which actually reaches to a farmer and must meet the standards of seed certification prescribed in the Indian Minimum Seeds Certification
- Standards, 1988.
30. Why is it important to have crop rotation?
- Most importantly: By crop rotation we avoid the carry-over of pests and diseases from one season to the other. (e.g. bacterial wilt, early blight and nematodes)
- Different crops have different nutrient requirements, so the soil is not depleted.
- Integration of legumes creates a N input.
- See section 2.2.2 31. What is the optimum temperature for tomato crop?
- Temperatures below 13°C negatively affect fruit set and can lead to misshapen fruit. Below 10°C, fruit set is poor. The optimum temperature for fruit set is between 18°C and 26°C. Above 35°C fruit
- set is reduced. Temperatures above 40°C affect growth and plant fitness negatively. (see 2.1.1)

Common problems that can be easily overcome
Practice Practical impacts
Not pre-ordering of seedlings Lack of available seedlings of the preferred variety for timely transplanting, leading to a delay
in the cropping season, a compromise on seedling quality and reduced returns
No emphasis on quality seedlings Poor crop stand,High mortality at a young age
High incidence of viral diseases
Dense planting of seedlings Allows no free circulation of air, encourages pests and diseases

## Transplanting Immediately After Herbicide Applica- Detrimental Effect On Seedlings Leading To High Tion Mortality

Over fertilization High vegetative growth and a few flowers, Scorch- ing and burning of leaves
Cracking of fruits, Unwanted expenditure, Soil pollution
Repeated planting of tomato in the same field Carrying over of pests and fungal bacterial season after season spores to the next crop reducing yields and returns
Excess irrigation Increased occurrence of damping off and other fungal diseases
Mixing many chemicals to be sprayed at once Incompatibility of chemicals reduces their effec- tiveness. Increased costs with poor control, wast-
