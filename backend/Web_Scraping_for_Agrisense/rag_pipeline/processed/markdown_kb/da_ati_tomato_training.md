About the Module
This module was prepared for Agricultural Extension workers in the promotion of Long-term harvesting of tomatoes and sweet peppers in greenhouses/rainshelters. It consists of technologies from soil conditioning, use of appropriate varieties, tomato grafting, cultural management practices and cropping systems to enhance profitability of farmers.
It contains of the following technologies presented as lessons:
Lesson 1 Soil Conditioning Through Green Manure Crops
Lesson2 Soil Analysis and Fertilizer Recommendation
Lesson3 Grafting of Tomato Seedlings
Lesson4 Tomato Cultivation Method for Long Term Harvesting Lesson 5 Sweet Pepper Cultivation Method for Long Term Harvesting Lesson 6 Plant Nutrition Diagnosis
Lesson 7 Disease Management of Tomato and Sweet Pepper
Lesson 8 Management of Pests and Tomato and Sweet Pepper Lesson 9 Planning of Cropping System
This module was developed with technical inputs from MV2C Horticulture expert Kubota Aki. Lesson writers are from the office of the Municipal Agriculture -Atok, Provincial Agriculture Office-Benguet, HVCDP-DA-RFU-CAR, Baguio National Crop Research and Development and Production Support Center and Kubota Aki. Lay-out and editing was done by the Agricultural Training Institute-Cordillera Administrative Region.
Long-term Harvesting under Facility Cultivation was introduced by MV2C in selected sites in Benguet from 2023-2025 as a way to mitigate risks due to unpredictable price fluctuations, a common problem in the vegetable industry. With long-term harvesting, farmers can harvest for more than 6 months compared to the traditional system of open field cultivation wherein harvest is from 2-3 months. With long-term harvesting, farmers can have better profits because they can hit both low and high price spikes compared to the traditional short term harvest which can lead to losses if harvest happens at times when prices are low.
Long-term harvesting will be promoted in other municipalities of Benguet and in other provinces of the country with similar agro-climatic conditions to Benguet in 2026-2027 in the dissemination phase of MV2C. This manual can also be used beyond MV2C if more farmers would clamor for long-term harvesting technique. Moreover, the lessons were prepared as stand-alone materials and could be used separately in case only specific topics are required.
