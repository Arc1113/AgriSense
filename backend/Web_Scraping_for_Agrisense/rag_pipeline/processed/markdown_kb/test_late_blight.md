## Overview

Late Blight Management in Tomatoes
Late Blight of Tomato

## Disease Information

Late blight, caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans, is one of the most destructive diseases of tomato and potato worldwide. The disease can rapidly destroy entire
fields under favorable environmental conditions.

## Symptoms

Initial symptoms appear as water-soaked lesions on leaves, typically starting on lower foliage. Under humid conditions, a white fuzzy growth (sporangia) develops on the underside
of leaves. Lesions quickly turn brown to black and coalesce, causing extensive leaf blight.
On stems, late blight causes dark brown to black lesions that can girdle the plant.
Fruit infection results in large, greasy-appearing brown spots that remain firm.

## Disease Cycle

The pathogen overwinters in infected potato tubers or tomato debris. Sporangia are produced on infected tissue and disseminated by wind and rain. Under cool (15-20°C) and
wet conditions, sporangia germinate within hours and infect plant tissue.

## Cultural Practices

Plant resistant or tolerant varieties when available
Avoid overhead irrigation; use drip irrigation instead
Space plants adequately to promote air circulation
Remove and destroy infected plant debris
Rotate crops with non-host plants for at least 2 years

## Chemical Control

Preventive fungicide applications are critical for late blight management. Start applications before disease appears, especially during periods of favorable weather.
Chlorothalonil : Broad-spectrum protectant fungicide. Apply at
7-10 day intervals. Rate: 1.5-2.0 lb/acre.
Mancozeb : Multi-site protectant fungicide. Apply at 7-10 day
intervals. Rate: 1.5-2.0 lb/acre.
Copper-based products : Organic option. Apply weekly during
disease-favorable conditions. Various formulations available.
Azoxystrobin : Systemic fungicide with protectant and curative
activity. Alternate with protectant fungicides to prevent resistance. Rate: 6.0-15.5 fl oz/acre.
Mandipropamid : Systemic fungicide specific for oomycetes.
Tank-mix with protectant fungicides. Rate: 5.5-8.0 fl oz/acre.
Integrated Approach
Best results are achieved by combining cultural practices with timely fungicide applications. Monitor weather forecasts and use disease prediction models like Blitecast
or Tomcast to optimize spray timing.
Regional Considerations - Philippines
In the Philippines, late blight is particularly severe in highland tomato production areas during the wet season. Mountain provinces like Benguet experience significant losses
if preventive measures are not implemented.
The Department of Agriculture recommends starting fungicide applications at first flower and continuing throughout the season during rainy periods. Combination products containing
both protectant and systemic fungicides are widely used.
